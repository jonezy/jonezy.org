<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a 38 year old male living in Toronto. I am an senior software engineer at <a href="http://www.q4websystems.com">Q4 Web Systems</a>. This is my 18th year doing this and it's still my favourite thing in the world.</p>
<p>I'm also a co-founder of a Toronto area developer meet up called <a href="http://www.devto.ca/">#DevTO</a>.  Once a month we host 150 or so developers from around the Toronto area for talks, beer and pizza. </p>
<p>In my spare time I run a podcast network (well, aspiring as of this writing) called <a href="http://www.the416.net">The 416</a>. Our flagship show <a href="http://www.the416.net/416/">The 416 Show</a> is hosted by myself and fellow DevTO co founder Nael Shawwa.</p>
<p>I built an app that helps you find a bus or streetcar in the city of Toronto, it's called <a href="http://www.findttc.com">Find TTC</a>. If your a developer you can check the project out on <a href="http://www.github.com/jonezy/findttc/">github</a></p>
<p>Over the years I've worked at agencies, done freelance and helped start 2 succesful companies (<a href="http://www.q4websystems.com">Q4 Web Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.epilogger.com/">Epilogger</a>)</p>
