<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a 36 year old male living in Toronto. I am an application/software/web developer at <a href="http://www.richmondday.com">Richmond Day</a>. This is my 16th year doing this and it's still my favourite thing in the world.</p>
<p>I'm also a co-founder of a Toronto area developer meet up called <a href="http://www.devto.ca/">#DevTO</a>.  Once a month we host 150 or so developers from around the Toronto area for talks, beer and pizza. </p>
<p>I built an app that helps you find a bus or streetcar in the city of Toronto, it's called <a href="http://www.findttc.com">Find TTC</a>. If your a developer you can check the project out on <a href="http://www.github.com/jonezy/findttc/">github</a></p>
<p>Over the years I've worked at agencies, done freelance and helped start 2 succesful companies (<a href="http://www.q4websystems.com">Q4 Web Systems</a> and <a href="http://www.epilogger.com/">Epilogger</a>)</p>
<p>Here are some languages/frameworks that I know and have been actively working with recently.</p>
