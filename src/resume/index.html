        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Chris Jones.  I am a 37 year old male living in Etobicoke Ontario. I'm divorced and happily recomitted. I also have 3 wonderul children ranging in age from 7 - 16.</p>
        <p>I have been a web developer since 1996 (almost 20 years!), it's the first real job that I had 
        after high school and I hope that it will be the last job I have before I retire.</p>
        <p>For the past 12 years I have been working mainly with Microsoft technologies on the server side (ASP.NET Web Forms and now ASP.NET MVC) as well as having worked with html/css/js for all of my career</p>
        <p>In my free (hah) time, I enjoy talking about politics and current events, I love movies (specifically science fiction) and lately I've been trying to find
        my writers voice (not having a lot of luck in this department).  My other main passion that I spend a great deal of my free time on is #DevTO! More on that below.</p>

        <p>Currently my focus is on full stack web development with ASP.NET MVC as the server side component
        in the stack.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this kind of development for the last 5 years and I've found that it 
        enables me to focus on solving problems rather than worrying about who will design the database, or who's going
        to make the login screen work. It's a great way to get a lot of work done, and I love it!</p>

        <p>While this full stack development makes up most of what I do during the day, at night and on the weekends I spend
        my time learning new things, most recently I've spending time playing around with and learning node.js.</p>

        <p>Over the years i've had the luck to be able to work in many different roles, including: front end developer, network admin, 
        dev ops, customer support, product management just to name a few.  I feel that this broad experience has helped me be a better 
        developer.</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>

        <h3>DevTO <small>| <a href="http://www.devto.ca" target="_blank">http://www.devto.ca</a> | 2011 - Current</small></h3>
        <p>In early 2011 I put a call out over twitter to see who would be interested in working on a tech meetup with a social focus.  To my surprise 3 
        people spoke up pretty quickly and about a month later we were hosting our very first #DevTO (we had 20 people and 4 cases of beer).</p>
        <p>Since then we've grown to having ~200 per event, 10 cases of beer and 10 party size pizza's per event.  We've also hosted over 60 excellent talks
        and fielded countless questions during our events</p>
        <p>Starting this year and continuing into next, we are going to be sponsoring some of our fellow meetup groups to ensure that they are financial able to make it 
        through the next year and put on amazing events</p>

        <h3>Epilogger <small>| <a href="http://www.epilogger.com" target="_blank">http://www.epilogger.com</a> | 2010 - 2011</small></h3>
        <p>I joined the Epilogger team with express goal of helping them completely rewrite the application before entering a startup accelerator (Founder Fuel).</p>
        <p>In just a few months myself and the other developer on the project were able to complete an entire rewrite as well as introducing features to allow
        for the inevitable scaling of the application (moved collection services to use an event based system, moved tweet storage to azure tables).</p>
        <p>In the spring of 2011 Epilogger was accepted into the Founder Fuel program, the project was funded and is still in operation today</p>

        <h3>Richmond Day <small>| <a href="http://www.richmondday.com" target="_blank">http://www.richmondday.com</a> | 2008 - Current</small></h3>
        <p>Richmond Day is a small marketing / design agency located in Liberty Village.  It's focus is on integrated print and digital offerings</p>
        <p>In my time at Richmond Day I built an internal product for enabling that rapid development of client sites, I've architected and built some 
        of our largest projects (<a href="http://www.buildmymini.ca">buildmymini.ca</a>, <a href="http://mini.richmondday.com">mini.ca</a>).</p>
        <p>My primary responsibilites are the design, execution and maintenance of database backed web applications</p>

        <h3>Q4 Web Systems <small>| <a href="http://www.q4websystems.com" target="_blank">http://www.q4websystems.com</a> | 2004 - 2008</small></h3>
        <p>Q4 Web Systems was born out of Weave Communications.  The main owner at Weave Communications was ready to start something new so myself and another developer 
        and the time started working on a product in our spare time that would eventually become the product that is stll being sold and used today at Q4 Web Systems.</p>

        <p>I was fortunate enough to be a part of Q4 from the very beginning.  Because of this I was able to play many roles in bringing the company to market.  At various times I acted as:
        a member of the product dev team, customer support, user experience lead and implementation manager. </p>

        <h3>Weave Communications <small>| <a href="http://www.weavecommunications.com" target="_blank">http://www.weavecommunications.com</a> | 1997 - 2005</small></h3>
        <p>Weave Communications (originally NKaos Interactive Media) is where I got my start as a web developer.  We started in a small apartment on the danforth in 1997 and 
        quickly moved into 579 Richmond St the next year.</p>

        <p>We were lucky enough to be involved in building some of the first websites for some large canadian brands such as
        Northern Reflections, Le Chateau and TD Bank. We buily ecommerce sites, internal financial tools, newsletter marketing campaigns</p>

        <p>During my time at Weave Communications I wore many hats, from front end developer to network engineer to devops (it wasn't called this back then!).  It was an
        amazing learning experience that has seen me through my career</p>
