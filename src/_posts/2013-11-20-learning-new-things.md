I happened to stumble on the [Feynman
Technique](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/04/learn-anything-faster-with-the-feynman-technique/)
recently.  It's basically a system for learning new things.  It goes a
bit like this:

1. Choose the concept you wish to understand
2. Pretend your teaching the concept to someone else.
3. If you get stuck, go back to the book.
4. Simplify.

This seems like a pretty good system to me.  There have a been a couple
of cases in the last month or two when someone has asked me to explain a
basic part of my job (what is javascript, what is responsive design) and
I found that I was unable to give a clear answer.

I'm going to experiment with the Feynman technique and write some blog
posts explaining things about what I do, so that when I am asked I will
have clear and concise answers!
