[Listn to Grinnin In Your Face by Son
House](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx1OFl_y-ic)

I first heard this song while watching the documentary "It Might Get
Loud".  In the film Jack White from the white stripes talks about his
favourite song of all time, this is it.  I immediately tracked the song
down, expecting a bit of a blues rambler, maybe some acoustic guitars, a
touch of piano. Boy was I surprised.

Grinnin in your face consists of 1 thing.  Son House clapping (mostly
off time) and singing. In our modern age of massive studio's, pro tools
and computers you would think that this song would fall flat in terms of
what my expectations would be.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

The complete and utter rawness of this song is almost too much to handle
(for me anyways).  The lyrics are simple, the time is 4/4 and is simple.
But there is so much more to consider.  A black man who grew up in the
racially charged south talking about being the bigger person and
understanding that people arund you are going to try and take advantage
of you.  This advice, likely written and sung in the 50's and 60's rings
incredibly true to me even now.

The implication that people will say one thing to your face, while
saying another behind your back is just so simply put.  There are no
great metaphors here, no visual worlds painted with words.  There is
only the simple truth.

<strong>So bear this in mind, a true friend is hard to find.  Don't you mind
people grinnin in your face.</strong>
