I have a bit of a confession to make.  I notice things, and sometimes,
these things bother me.  I try really hard to be empathetic and
understanding, I really do.  But jesus fucking christ I have had enough
of one particular thing.

> Some people have no idea how to walk in public.

Now I do have to qualify what I mean by some people. What I really mean
is that *groups* of people have no idea how to walk in public.  Let me
present a scenario.

You are alone, walking down queen street in Toronto.  A group of people
approaches, they are walking 3 wide on a street that is designed for 2
people to walk side by side (and specifically, walking in opposite
directions). Now common fucking sense would dictate that the 3
approaching should form a single line until you pass and then resume
their complete dominance of the sidewalk.

Now, how often does this happen?  Not fucking nearly enough I say.

I'm not even interested in being all preachy and saying hey people that
walk in groups in the city don't be dicks and respect other people using
the sidewalk, but you know what? Nobody listens, so fuck that.

I really honestly didn't even want to write this blog post, I swear I
almost can't stand myself for being such a whiny asshole.

You know what groups of people that walk around in the city taking up
the entire sidewalk?  Do whatever the fuck you want, I really don't
care.
