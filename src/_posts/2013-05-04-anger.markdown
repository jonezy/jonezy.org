There is a great deal happening right now that should make people angry.
But nobody is angry and frankly I find that disturbing.  I mean people
do get angry, you've seen someone freaking out in a fast food place
because someone making 9 bucks an hour didn't get there order right.
Or how about instagram deciding that they want to make some money so
they will sell the photo's you store for free on the servers they pay
for to advertisers to make some cash so you can keep using the server,
complete fucking meltdown right.

It seems as though we no longer care about what is done to as a whole,
if our individual wants or needs are threatened in any way then it's
fight the good fight, but, if as a society, hell as a species if there
is trouble on the horizon, it seems as though this is of no concern
