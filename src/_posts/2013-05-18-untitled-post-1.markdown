I desperately want to write a blog post espousing my feelings bout being
a developer, but honestly they are a dime a dozen, everyone talks about
their feelings/give advice/bitch and complain about being a developer.
There is no shortage of that.

It's funny, there's an entire market of problems to solve right there
before our eyes.  The problems aren't sexy, they aren't attention
getters but they are real and they affect all kinds of us.

I'm not even talking about tooling issues or open source problems.  I
mean the happiness issues, pyschological issues and career issues that
exist that need to be solved that nobody is paying attention to.

Maybe I shouldn't have put this online.
