Often times you hear the expression 'if you could go back and change
things, would you?'. The typical response is that no, most people would
not go back and do things differently.  The reasons are vast and aren't
really the point here.

My point today is to admit that I would, in fact, go back and change
some of the decisions and choices I have made in the past.  This doesn't
mean that I spend all my time stuck in the past wishing i could change
things.  There is a difference between being honest about something and
being stuck in the past.

This very question was posed to me a few weeks ago by a friend who had
recently become a father (I'm a divorced father of 3).  I have been
asked this question before, and I have given the typical answer, that
no, I wouldn't go back and change anything.

But this time was different.  I knew that I had to be honest with this
person, how I could tell them that everything I did while being a new
father was right, when I know that deep down, i was not doing the things
a new father should be doing.

This time I had to tell the truth.

Yes, I would go back and change things:

- I would spend less time working.
- and more time with my kids.
- I would spend more time doing things that made me happy.
- I would pay more attention to the people I cared about.

The next time someone asks you this question, instead of giving the same
answer everyone else does, try telling the truth.
