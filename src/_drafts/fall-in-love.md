It occurred to me the other how incredibly amazing it is to be in love.
like in the movies in love.  Like in the books in love.  What other
possible thing could be better than this?  Why is it that I think I need
to somehow be more successful, when at 36 years old I have one of the
most fulfilling and satisfying things I could ever possibly imagine
having?

You should try falling in love.
