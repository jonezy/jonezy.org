Sometimes, especially for me, the way that I am feeling is easier to
summarize through the words of a song, rather than words of my own.

> Fed up with all that LSD.<br /> Need more sleep than coke or methamphetamines. <br/> Late nights with warm, warm whiskey. <br /> I guess the good times they were all just killing me. <br /><small>Modest Mouse - The good times are killing me</small>

For some reason this Modest Mouse song most accurately represents the
way that I've been feeling lately. I'm not even going to try and assign
a standard emotion to this, honestly, it would be pointless.
