- it is a scripting language originally intended to be used in browsers.
- html is the structure, css is the looks, javascript is the action
- it was invented at netscape to be included in the very early versions
  of netscape navigator
- to write javascript all you need is a text editor and a web browser.
- javascript has gone on to be a much more mature lanuage in recent
  years with things like jQuery, Backbone, Ember and Angular (libraries
  and frameworks) and node.js (server side javascript)
