My relationship with twitter has gotten to the point where it's not just
an echo chamber inside industries but it's become something of a
personal echo chamber.  

Most people's accounts are a broadcast of who they are, it is a
reaffirmation of their individuality a constant never ending reminder to
all that will listen of who they are.

The problem is that this is something of an instance of confirmation
bias.  Most often these broadcasts are never challenged (who wants to
have a discussion online anyways?) resulting in the author of these
opinions never really being challenged.

The lack of challenge seems to result in a personal echo chamber.  The
obvious conclusion to the author is that if nobody challenges their
opinion then it must be correct.  When in fact, the opposite is true.
The author should seek to have their opinion validated if only for the
complete lack there of.
