For the first time in my professional career, and perhaps in my life, I
will have taken control and made a decision about where my career will
be going over the next 5-10 years rather than letting my career pull me,
my life and anyone else along for the ride.

For too many years I put the needs of others before my own. Working late
and believing in the common theme of this industry.  That working hard
now will pay off for you later.  But that is a lie, a lie to keep you
working and not wondering.
