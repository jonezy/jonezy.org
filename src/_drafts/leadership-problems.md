Are you constantly having meetings to try and make changes in your company?  Do you feel like no matter how hard you try that nothing ever changes at your place of employment?

  than the whole
- Not taking the time to figure out exactly why projects are failing.

- Is there talk about bringing back or introducting timesheets?
