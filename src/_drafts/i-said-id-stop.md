That's what I kept telling myself, every monday, this time I'll stop.

It's not as though I woke up in a different city, penniless and only in
possession of rambling fuzzy memories.

But every monday morning in the shower I think to myself.  This time
I'll stop, this time I won't when they are here.  I've started calling
these incidents 'motivational mondays'.

- for some reason monday mornings are like this
- why aren't other mornings like this?
